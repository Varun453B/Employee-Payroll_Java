# üßë‚Äçüíº Java Payroll Management System

Welcome to the **Java Payroll Management System**, an elegant solution crafted with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to streamline your employee management process. This project is designed to efficiently handle both full-time and part-time employees, making it a versatile tool for any business.

## üåü Features

### üîß Abstract `Employee` Class
- **Blueprint for Employees:** The `Employee` class sets the foundation for all employee types, encapsulating essential attributes like `name` and `id`.
- **Abstract Salary Calculation:** By defining an abstract method `calculateSalary()`, we ensure that each employee type has its own unique way of calculating their salary.

### üíº Full-Time Employees
- **Class: `FullTimeEmployee`**
- **Fixed Monthly Salary:** This class is tailored for full-time employees, where the salary is calculated on a monthly basis.
- **Straightforward Salary Calculation:** Simply returns the fixed monthly salary.

### ‚è∞ Part-Time Employees
- **Class: `PartTimeEmployee`**
- **Flexible Hourly Wage:** Designed for part-time employees, this class calculates salary based on hours worked and the hourly rate.
- **Dynamic Salary Calculation:** Implements a flexible formula: `hourWorked * hourlyRate`.

### üìä Payroll System Management
- **Class: `PayrollSystem`**
- **Seamless Employee Management:** Manage your workforce with ease using an `ArrayList` to store employee data.
- **Add and Remove Employees:** Efficiently add new employees and remove existing ones by their ID.
- **Display Employee Data:** A comprehensive display of all employees, including their calculated salaries.

### üöÄ Main Program Execution
- **Class: `Manager`**
- **Interactive Example:** The `Manager` class brings the Payroll System to life, showcasing its capabilities by adding, removing, and displaying employee data.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Ensure you have JDK installed on your system.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Varun453B/Employee_Payroll_Java.git
   cd Employee_Payroll_Java
   ```

2. **Compile the Code:**
   ```bash
   javac Manager.java
   ```

3. **Run the Program:**
   ```bash
   java Manager
   ```

### Example Output
```bash
DataBase:

Name = Bawa
id = 102
Salary = 450.0

Remove:
Total Employees:
Employee Details -->
Name = Varun
id = 101
Salary = 5000.0
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

Feel free to extend this project by adding new types of employees, adjusting the salary calculation methods, or integrating more complex payroll functionalities.

## üìö Learning Objectives

This project is not just a tool but also a learning experience, demonstrating key OOP concepts:
- **Abstraction:** Abstract classes and methods.
- **Inheritance:** Extending base classes.
- **Polymorphism:** Overriding methods.
- **Encapsulation:** Protecting and managing employee data.
